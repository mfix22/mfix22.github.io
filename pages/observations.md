- A young man is riding the bus home from school—Gen Z beyond the shadow of a doubt. He gets a call:

  "No I can't, I have therapy."  
  ...  
  "Well, sure. Come by later."

  He hangs up and immediately makes another call:

  "Can the guys come by for 30 minutes? They are in the neighborhood."  
  ...  
  "For sure, for sure, thanks. Love you."

  He flips his flip phone shut.
